# Association of VDR gene TaqI polymorphism and the risk of Parkinson's disease in three genetic model

## Metods:
* **Literature search:** Pubmed and ResearchGate.
* **Quality assessment:** The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle - Ottawa (NOS) scale
* **Analysis:** 
  * technologies: A metabin library from the R. 
  * OR and 95% was calculated to measure the genetic relationship between VDR polymorphisms and PD risk in three genetic models, including
    * the codominative model (MM vs. WW), 
    * the dominant model (MM + MW vs. WW) and 
    * the recessive model (MM vs. MW + WW). 
    In this case, 'W' and 'M' mean 'wild type' and 'mutant type' respectively. 
  * The significance of the test was determined by means of test &chi;2 in which p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
  * A forest plot was used to graphically represent the results.
